** Overview
This project aims to develop a web browser using the LÖVE framework. The browser will allow users to browse the internet, render web content, and provide essential browser functionalities.

** Architecture
The web browser project follows a client-server architecture. The client side is built using the LÖVE framework, which provides the necessary tools for creating a graphical user interface and handling user interactions. On the server side, the browser communicates with web servers using HTTP(S) protocols to retrieve web content.
